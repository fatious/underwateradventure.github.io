               <p> Did you know in early cultures suach as Egypt, Greece and in Roman culture were known to have kept fish as pets. The most important factor to the start up and popularity was the Goldfish. First documented in in 960 AD ponds were stocked with goldfish and gaining popularity withing the priviliged during the Sung Dynasty in China. Emperor Haiu-Tsung started breeding and keeping fish in a more controlled envoirment  in 1136. This led to several new breeds of fish to spawn and evolve. Ever since then the hobby of keeping fish has grown and gained popularity during the 1950s. With more advanced technology on filtration and proper feeding with live and flake food being invented,the hobby has flourished and grew more. With hobbyist and breeders helping with the growth, people today can enjoy fish keeping with little to no hassle at all.  </p>
